  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - res/images/logo.png
    - res/locales/en.json
    - res/locales/fr.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: OpenSans
       fonts:
          - asset: res/fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf
            style: normal

          - asset: res/fonts/OpenSans-LightItalic.ttf
            style: italic
            weight: 300

          - asset: res/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
